The game is called "Jouster" inspired by jousting tournaments in real life. 

The goal is to beat the other knight either by knocking him off the horse or survive with more health points after 3 rounds. 
In the beginning you can select single/multiplayer (start_screen.py). 
Singleplayer takes you to a game with GUI and against computer created knight. Multiplayer is text based and 2 players can play on one screen. 

After that you can select your armor, weapon and speed of the horse (GUIstart.py). Armor gives you defense points, weapon and speed gives you attack points.
Bigger the better but also bigger takes away more health points by default. So if you take plate armor, biggest weapon and fast horse you can do a lot of damage
but also lose bigger amount of HP just by having the heaviest equipment. 

You can also setup your own name as well. 

Next screen (vyber.py) takes you to a selection of body part which you will attack with your weapon
and once more the same screen where you will select which body part you will cover with a shield.

Then animation shows a knights clash (animation_final.py) and results will be shown in command line. 
3 rounds of that and may the best one win.
